# Sample Project

## Ticketing Platform on IOTA

### User Flow
- User visits a concert page. Purchases a ticket using IOTAs.
- Receives a ticket on ticket dapp, which has a QR code attached. (It can also be a card with NFC).
- Scans QR code against the door camera.
- Door will send the QR Code info or ticket key to the server.
- Server validates the QR code and returns success/failure based on if the ticket exists and/or if the ticket has already been scanned.

### Client-Side (js)
- Send a message to server with key.

### Server-side (python)
- Endpont to receive key and return confirmation.


From Comments (to be explored):

The concert page is the server, it receives a payment and create a new ticket. A message with the ticket and corresponding door is sent to iota network. The doors check its corresponding topic("door/1") and update its local database of allowed tickets.
