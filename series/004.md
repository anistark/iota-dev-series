## Ticketing Platform on IOTA

### User Flow
- User visits a concert page. Purchases a ticket using IOTAs.
- Receives a ticket on mail, which has a QR code attached. (It can also be a card with NFC).
- Scans QR code against the door camera.
- Door will send the QR Code info or ticket key to the server.
- Server validates the QR code and returns success/failure based on if the ticket exists and/or if the ticket has already been scanned.

### Client-Side (js)

### Server-side (python)
